Rice Image Dataset for CPTR435 Final Project

---

For my final project, I'm using the [Rice Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset) from Kaggle.

I used the [Rice MSC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-msc-dataset/) for HW 4, and so I decided to try and implement a CNN on the image dataset and see if I can match/exceed the performance of my HW 4 model.

This repository is just so that I know that I can point my notebook here to access all the images.
